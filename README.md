# K-Nearest-Neighbours

To compile and execute the program:

1- Compile the source code using the command:
    javac KNN.java 
    
2-  Execute the compiled files using the command:
    java KNN iris-training.txt iris-test.txt

The objective of this program is to use the training data to identify the K-nearest neighbours, in order to classify the instances of the test set. I have provided the program with the iris dataset which has been split into training and test set.
